DECODE Documentation
====================================
This is the documentation of the DECODE Deep Learning for Superresolution Localization Microscopy.

Usage and Installation
======================
To try out the package we recommend the Google Colab notebooks which comprise training a model and fitting experimental data.

Google Colab Notebooks
######################
We prepared two example notebooks on Google Colab so you can test DECODE without the need to install it locally.

* `Training <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18V1TLLu63CXSWihwoGX7ZQ5wj0Qk7GnD?usp=sharing>`_ of the model based on your data
* `Fitting <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O0mjuOjaOl0wnLZ11Xo92IsWrgqtXL17?usp=sharing>`_ of your high density localization microscopy data

Local installation
######################
Instructions for local installation can be found `here <./installation.html>`_.
