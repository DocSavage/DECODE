DECODE Manual
=============
This is the documentation of the DECODE Deep Learning for Superresolution Localization Microscopy.


DECODE on Google Colab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To try out DECODE we recommend to have a look at the Google Colab notebooks which comprise training
a model, fitting experimental data and exporting the fitted localizations.

* `Training <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uQ7w1zaqpy9EIjUdaLyte99FJIhJ6N8E?usp=sharing>`_ of the model based on your data
* `Fitting <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HAvJUL29vVuCHMZHMbU9jxd4fbLIPdhZ?usp=sharing>`_ of your high density localization microscopy data

Video tutorial
###############
We held a workshop at the I2K 2020 conference. You can find the recording below.
Please note that the development of DECODE is ongoing and the code shown in the video might slightly
differ from the current version. Refer to the notebooks described in the Tutorial.
