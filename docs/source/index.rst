DECODE Manual
=============
This is the documentation of the DECODE Deep Learning for Superresolution Localization Microscopy.


DECODE on Google Colab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To try out DECODE we recommend to have a look at the Google Colab notebooks which comprise training
a model, fitting experimental data and exporting the fitted localizations.

* `Training <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uQ7w1zaqpy9EIjUdaLyte99FJIhJ6N8E?usp=sharing>`_ of the model based on your data
* `Fitting <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HAvJUL29vVuCHMZHMbU9jxd4fbLIPdhZ?usp=sharing>`_ of your high density localization microscopy data

As part of the virtual `I2K 2020
<https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/conferences/from-images-to-knowledge-with-imagej-friends>`__
conference we organized a workshop on DECODE. Please find the video below.
*DECODE is being actively developed, therefore the exact commands might differ
from those shown in the video.*
